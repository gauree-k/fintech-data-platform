# fintech-data-platform
An evolving fintech data platform designed to explore scalable data modeling, reliable pipelines, observability, and AI-assisted data operations.

**Why this project exists**

Modern data platforms are not just about moving data from point A to point B. They require careful consideration of data modeling, correctness, rerunnability, monitoring, and long-term maintainability.

**This project exists to:**
1. Practice designing clear and scalable data models
2. Implement reliable ingestion patterns that are safe to rerun
3. Understand incremental processing and data evolution
4. Build observability into data pipelines from the start
5. Explore practical, responsible ways to apply AI in data operations

_All data and scenarios in this repository are synthetic and created solely for learning and experimentation._
