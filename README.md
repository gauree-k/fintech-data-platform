# fintech-data-platform
An evolving fintech data platform designed to explore scalable data modeling, reliable pipelines, observability, and AI-assisted data operations.

**Why this project exists**
Modern data platforms are not just about moving data from point A to point B. They require careful consideration of data modeling, correctness, rerunnability, monitoring, and long-term maintainability.

**This project exists to:**
Practice designing clear and scalable data models
Implement reliable ingestion patterns that are safe to rerun
Understand incremental processing and data evolution
Build observability into data pipelines from the start
Explore practical, responsible ways to apply AI in data operations
_All data and scenarios in this repository are synthetic and created solely for learning and experimentation._
